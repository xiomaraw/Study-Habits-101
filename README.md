# Study-Habits-101
Semester-long project created from Rockland Community College Course: Web Development 101

## Why did you create this website?
I created this website to encourage students to become successful by showcasing different resources and tips. With this website, I have exceeded my project target of improving students grades by 15%. 

## What determined you to create Study Habits 101?
Over the course of my high school and college career I have picked up a few study habits that I believe will help you become a more successful student. By having great study habits they will lead to students succeeding in their field of study. The key to studying isn't about cramming or studying longer for a test, but studying smarter. There are different study habits for many courses and websites that will help you study.
