      <h2>Health</h2>
        <p> Although studying and getting good grades are amazing, health is very important. It is very easy to loose track of your mental and physical health while you are studying for exams and doing homework. It is very wise to take frequent breaks when you are studying, for instance you can do a quick 5-minute session of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C-gxOE0j7s">yoga</a> to loosen your muscles. Also, if you are stuck on a difficult question it is easier to take a quick break to clear your mind and grab something to eat. If you didn't take a break, your mind would be confused and frustrated trying to figure out a difficult problem.</p>
      <h3>Self Care</h3>
        <p>These are some of my favorite things to do for myself when ever I'm stressed.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Face mask: could be a clay, sheet, or cloud mask</li>
            <li>Yoga: Allows me to be free and stretch my tight muscles that have been in a chair for over two hours.</li>
            <li>Meditation: Allows me to focus on my mind and breathing. It makes me more self aware of my thoughts, decisions and actions that will happen in the future.</li>
            <li>Bath: Eases my nerves and makes me relax</li>
            <li>Mini-declutter: Cleaning up my desk area or room makes me feel less clastrpohbic and able to focus on my work</li>
          </ul>
